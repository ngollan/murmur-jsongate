h1. Murmur Ice-to-JSON gateway

Provides a basic framework to translate Murmur's Ice callbacks to requests to a web service to facilitate authentication.

h2. Basic Use

See the supplied jsongate.py script for basic usage information.

The "murmur" module provides a "Murmur" module created by Ice. By default, the Slice file is loaded from /usr/share/slice/Murmur.ice; to provide a different Slice file, set the environment variable MURMUR_SLICE_PATH.

h2. Authenticator

The authenticator has three basic settings:
* base_uri (default: http://localhost:9000/): Base URI for the authentication server. You can set any value, as long as it is supported by urllib2 and allows appending a relative path fragment.
* known_user_info: Allowed user information types (defaults to values allowed in Mumble 1.2.2)
* auth_api_token _(yet unused)_: API token to send to the authentication server.
